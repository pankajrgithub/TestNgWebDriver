TestNG is an open source,free
TestNG java unit testing frame work

It is available on Jar format, to use TestNG on project just add to TestNG jar file

TestNG is unit testing framework -used by java developer to execute unit testing 
TestNG also called- TDD (Test Driven Development) -used in Agile methodology kind of pre-requsite 

To download TestNG Eclipse plugin -->Go to Help-->Eclipse MarketPlace-->
Search TestNG and install latest plugin.

TestNG has different annotation to manage Test -
--Every Annotation should have a method to define that Annotation .
1. @BeforeSuit
2. @BeforeTest
3. @BeforeClass
4. @BeforeMethod
5. @Test
6. @AfterMethod
7. @AfterClass
8. @AfterTest
9. @DataProvider //most important annotation to provide data in loop

TestNG used for generate report in HTML format

TestNG used for manage Test--Sequence ,Dependency 

TestNG doesn't required main() method to execute test 
-----------------------------------------------------------
Features of TestNG framework-
1.priority=number  ---to set Test Case priority to execute test as priority 
2.Groups="name" ----group test case by using specific module name
3.depenendOnMethod="methodName" ---- test case dependent on particular method
4.expectedException="name of exception" ----it will ignore/handle exception at runtime for specific test case
5.invocationTimeout=2000(ms) -------- it will wait 2 second for than move to next case
6.Enabled=false   ------initialization this parameter at Test level will ignore to run this test.

Assertion - to validate test case with Actual and expected result

Assert.assertEqual(actual,expected, "message to show if fail")

testng.xml -file is used for to bind all the test cases together and execute them using single xml file
---------------------------------------------------
/Sequence to execute test-- pair will be created like this for every single Test
Chronological order
	@BeforeMethod
	@Test
	@AfterMethod
	
	
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	What is Assertion and their types?
	---Assertion means validation---- using Assert class we can achieve assertion validation in Selenium 
	Two types of Assertion -
	1.Hard Assertion
	2.Soft Assertion
	
	1.Hard Assertion--------- it will skip rest of Test execution if any assertion will get failed
	Assert.assertEquals(Expected,Actual,Message to show on fail)
	Assert.assertTrue(condition)  ----it will check return condition
	Assert.assertFalse(condition)  --------it is just opposite of assertTrue
	
	2.Soft Assertion
	It will continue execution if any assertion get failed
	to achieve soft assertion in selenium we have to create instance for SoftAssert class.
	
	SoftAssert soft=new SoftAssert() //if this instance created at class level and every test assertion using same softAssert object
	if in case any test will get failed remaining all test will get failed.
	To overcome this problem we have to create separate SoftAssert instance for every Test.
	
	Eg- SoftAssert soft=new SoftAssert();
	soft.assertEquals(Expected,Actual);
	soft.assertTrue(true);
	soft.assertFalse(false);
	
	soft.assertAll(); ----this assert is required if any assertion will get failed it will continue with next Test 
	
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	TestNG always execute Test using XML file without xml file TestNG test can't run
	if we are running a TestNG class it will by default create .XML file at home directory of project.
	We can create our own .XML file to manage TestNG test 
	
	---------------------------------------------------
	Listener --> to used Listener in selenium we have to extends below class
	TestListenerAdapter class - This class have feature to give deffination to @Test annotation on start, success and failure ,skipped
	This class having method like-
	
	onTestStart(ITestResult tr)
	onTestSuccess(ITestResult tr)
	onTestFailure(ITestResult tr)
	onTestSkipped(ITestResult tr)
	
	We can't run Listener class along we have to add Listener class at xml file with tag
	
	<listeners>
	<listener class-name=""/>
	
	</listeners>
	
	------------------------------------------
	Extent Report-
	
	setUp we have class
